# Giant sequoia, wildfire and vegetation and other climate factors


# Plan (subject to change)
09/28 updated  
1. understand what might be the more direct impact to the Sequoia habitat.
2. Find recent papers that study the same subjects - what are their conclusion, what are their methods and limitaiton? 
3. Find the data that might be relevant. 
    - vegetation in each year can be obtained from RAVG images
    - wild fire data can be obtained from Cal fire and Landset image gallery?
    - moisture data from LFMC of radiant MLHub
4. Prediction using the wildefire real time tracking? 


# data / resources: 
- [RAVG data](https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/ravg/) - **Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program**. this looks to be a fairly nice resource to obtain the recent wildfire data. -- how the vegetation before/after the wildfire affect the sequoia population? 
- [2021 fire season and impact on the giant sequpia](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/2021-fire-season-impacts-to-giant-sequoias.htm) - from NPS. 
- relatedly [impact of wildefire (2015-2020) for the sequoia](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/wildfires-kill-unprecedented-numbers-of-large-sequoia-trees.htm#:~:text=The%20Castle%20Fire%20killed%20an,%2Cor%20%3E1.2%20meters).)
- [Western US live fuel moisture: used to assess the wildfire risks](https://mlhub.earth/data/su_sar_moisture_content_main), from 'radiant MLHub'. 
    - 'Live fuel moisture content (LFMC)' - the mass of wataer per unit dry biomass in vegetation
- [Kaggle nature disaster data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataenergy/natural-disaster-data?resource=download) 1900-2018, with several missing values. 
- [awesome forest](https://github.com/blutjens/awesome-forests#tree-species-classification) - does not have wildfire related data. but might be relevant.
