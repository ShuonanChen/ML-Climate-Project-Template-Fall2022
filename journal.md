# want to understand more on the giant sequoia and wildfire (and potentially other factors that might be relevant)

1. find the data / resources: 
- [RAVG data](https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/ravg/) - Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program. this looks to be a fairly nice resource to obtain the recent wildfire data. 
- [2021 fire season and impact on the giant sequpia](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/2021-fire-season-impacts-to-giant-sequoias.htm) - from NPS need to read more.
