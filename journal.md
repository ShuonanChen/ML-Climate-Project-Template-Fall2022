# Giant sequoia, wildfire and vegetation
(and potentially other factors that might be relevant)

09/28
# Abstract (subject to change)
There are many climate factors that affect the Giant Sequoia habitat. The candidate factors includ soil moisture, total precipitation, daily sunlight, wintertime snowpack/runoff, fire frequencies, past exposure to fires, aerial CO2 concentration at different elevation. In my project I aim to disentangle the relationships between these factors and how it affects the Giant Sequoia habitat.

# data / resources: 
- [RAVG data](https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/ravg/) - **Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program**. this looks to be a fairly nice resource to obtain the recent wildfire data. -- how the vegetation before/after the wildfire affect the sequoia population? 
- [2021 fire season and impact on the giant sequpia](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/2021-fire-season-impacts-to-giant-sequoias.htm) - from NPS.
