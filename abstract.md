There are many climate factors that affect the Giant Sequoia habitat. The candidate factors includ soil moisture, total precipitation, daily sunlight, wintertime snowpack/runoff, fire frequencies (natural/prescribed), past exposure to fires, aerial CO2 concentration at different elevation. In my project I aim to disentangle the relationships between these factors and how it affects the Giant Sequoia habitat.
