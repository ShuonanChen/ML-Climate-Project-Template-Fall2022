(12/14 finalized)  

Wildfires in California cause many socioecological damages. While the impact is huge and getting larger in recent decades, not much is known about their impact and what factors might contribute the severity levels. 
% Current analysis on wildfire oftentimes assume that the consequences caused by wildfire is uniform across the regions. 
Here we take a modeling aproach based on Gaussian Process and explore if previously prescribed fire and hydrologic regions have impact on the severity of wildfire in California. We found that the prescribed fire has relatively small negative impact on the wildfire severity. We also found that some of the hydrologic regions have a large effect, especially the coastal area are more likely to be affected by severe wildfire. The model can be further extended to incorporate more explanatory variables which will help the climate scientists to study the best strategy to minimize the negative effect of wildfire.
